# TESTING

## Introduction

Software testing is a common practice and a crucial step in the development process that ensures the quality, functionality and reliability of a web application. There are two primary approaches to testing - manual and automated. They both play vital roles in the process.

Both manual and automated testing have their strengths and limitations, but let's focus on the strengths. Manual testing offers flexibility and human insight, while automated testing provides efficiency and repeatability. Combining these two approaches can help achieve comprehensive test coverage.

### Manual Testing

Manual Testing involves human testers who interact with the software and assess its behavior against predefined criteria. This method relies on the tester's intuition, experience, and creativity to identify defects, making it particularly effective in exploratory testing and scenarios where user interaction is complex or subjective. 

"Sagittarius A-Star: A Supermassive Book Store" has been tested manually to check if the project works according to the user stories, to check its performance in different browsers and to check its responsiveness at different resolutions. Some friends and family members were invited to test the app on their devices and to check for potential functionality issues.

### Automated Testing

Automated Testing, on the other hand, employs specialized testing tools and scripts to automate the execution of test cases and verification of results. It excels in repetitive, time-consuming, and regression testing scenarios, where the same tests need to be run repeatedly to ensure new code changes do not introduce defects. 

All tests described and documented in the Code Validation and the Lighthouse Audit sections are automated tests.
