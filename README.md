### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of "Sagittarius A-Star: A Supermassive Book Store" was generated from its background image, which captures the beauty of the universe. Because it plays a crucial role in setting the tone and atmosphere of the store, I wanted to keep it close to the astronomical theme by introducing the classic combination of black, silver and white, alongside two very different shades of the night sky: a subtle glaucous (a slightly desaturated blue) and an intense midnight green (a dark shade of cyan). The contrasting colour accent on the site is a mid-toned, golden grass shade called lion, which - as its name suggests - is a representation of the average colour of a lion's fur. I believe that, by being commonly associated with old book pages, it nicely breaks the cosmic convention here and adds a touch of warmth and balance.

I used [Image Colour Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to find the best shades in my home page background image, and [Coolors](https://coolors.co/000000-adadad-fafafa-ad9064-5e7ea8-194d60) to generate my colour palette.
